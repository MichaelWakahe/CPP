# README

These are samples in C and C++

## IDE

I recommend Visual Studio Code with the [Microsoft C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools).
Refer to [Using C++ on Linux in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux).

Launch VS Code individually for each C or CPP project. Set `gcc` as the compiler for C projects and `g++` as the
compiler for CPP projects.

Take note of the following files in the `.vscode` folder in your workspace:

* `tasks.json` (compiler build settings)
* `launch.json` (debugger settings)
* `c_cpp_properties.json` (compiler path and IntelliSense settings)

You can commit the above to Git if you heavily customize them.
